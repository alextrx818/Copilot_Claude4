# Football Bot Development Tools

This directory now includes two powerful development tools to make your workflow smoother:

## 🔄 Auto-Reload Watcher (`run_with_reload.sh`)

Automatically restarts the pipeline whenever you save any Python file.

### Usage:
```bash
./run_with_reload.sh
```

### What it does:
- Starts the continuous orchestrator pipeline
- Watches all `.py` files in the Football_bot directory
- When you save changes to any Python file, it automatically:
  1. Stops the running pipeline
  2. Restarts it with your new changes
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the watcher

### Perfect for:
- Making changes to any step and seeing immediate results
- Testing modifications to the orchestrator
- Continuous development without manual restarts

---

## 🧪 Development Tester (`dev_test.sh`)

Quick testing of individual pipeline steps without running the full pipeline.

### Usage:
```bash
./dev_test.sh 7           # Test step 7 only
./dev_test.sh 1-3         # Test steps 1 through 3 (coming soon)
./dev_test.sh all         # Test all steps sequentially
```

### Available Steps:
- `1` - Step 1 (Data fetch)
- `2` - Step 2 (Data processing)
- `3` - Step 3 (Analysis)
- `4` - Step 4 (Filtering)
- `5` - Step 5 (Match processing)
- `6` - Step 6 (Additional processing)
- `7` - Step 7 (Status filter & logging)
- `all` - Run all steps sequentially

### Perfect for:
- Testing a specific step you're working on
- Quick debugging without waiting for the full pipeline
- Validating changes before running auto-reload

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Recommended workflow for making changes:

1. **Quick test a specific step:**
   ```bash
   ./dev_test.sh 7
   ```

2. **Make your changes** to the Python files

3. **Test again to verify:**
   ```bash
   ./dev_test.sh 7
   ```

4. **Start auto-reload for continuous testing:**
   ```bash
   ./run_with_reload.sh
   ```

5. **Make further changes** - they'll automatically restart the pipeline

## 📁 File Locations

- **Main log output:** `/root/CascadeProjects/Football_bot/step7_matches.log`
- **Pipeline logs:** `/root/CascadeProjects/Football_bot/logs/`
- **Old files cleaned up:** The confusing `/step7/` subdirectory has been removed

---

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ **Step 7 is working perfectly!**
- Filters 38 live matches from 79 total matches
- Writes detailed match information to `step7_matches.log`
- Correctly reads from Step 5's output data
- Uses proper file paths (no more confusion)

✅ **Auto-reload functionality ready**
✅ **Development testing tools ready**
✅ **File structure cleaned up**

Happy coding! 🎉
